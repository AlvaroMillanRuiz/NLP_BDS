      "mr president, mr secretary-general, let me begin by reaffirming cuba’s solidarity with and support for the brotherly palestinian people, victims of more than 75 years of colonial occupation, flagrant violations of their legitimate national rights, subjected to cruelty, aggression, collective punishment, and apartheid. in the past eleven months, the israeli military has killed more than 40,000 civilians. in that indiscriminate and disproportionate massacre, more children than men and women have died. this is being carried out with the complicity and weapons provided by the united states government, and with the complicit silence of others. we pay tribute to the more than 220 un staff members who were also killed. cuba’s position is clear and unequivocal. president miguel díaz-canel bermúdez has declared: “history will not forgive the indifferent. and we will not be among them.” this is a wound on the conscience of humanity. the genocide against the palestinian people must end, unconditionally and without delay. israel, with the complicity of the us, has brought the world to the brink of a potentially devastating conflagration. the reckless aggression against lebanon, syria, iran, and the peoples of the middle east will have consequences that are difficult to predict. excellencies, seventy-nine years after the founding of this organisation, violations of the un charter and international law continue, along with aggression, interference in internal affairs, and the imposition of unilateral coercive measures for political purposes—all as daily occurrences. aggressive military doctrines of domination, expansionism, and supremacism are gravely undermining international peace and security. the danger of a nuclear catastrophe is real and immediate. for the ninth consecutive year, global military expenditure has increased, reaching a record $2.44 trillion in 2023, including the development of new nuclear weapons. despite the efforts of state parties and signatories of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and widespread civil society mobilisation, we have gone backwards. there will also be no peace without development. developed countries, living on the same planet, blindly refuse to invest minimally in the prosperity and security of all. they fail to meet even their insufficient commitments to official development assistance. the boastful promises made in 2023—quickly forgotten—amount to less than 0.37% of their national income. the hope of achieving the sustainable development goals has faded. these are structural crises, caused by the imperialist system and the international order imposed on us. no problem will be solved by undermining the intergovernmental character of the united nations, as some attempt, nor by weakening its role in promoting sustainable development for all. climate change is advancing inexorably. this is an irrefutable fact. in july 2024, scientists announced 13 consecutive months of record-breaking global temperatures. unless the irrational and unsustainable capitalist patterns of production and consumption are urgently and significantly changed, it will be impossible to keep the global average temperature increase below 1.5°c compared to pre-industrial levels. yes, responsibilities are shared, but also differentiated—they are not equal and cannot justly be treated as such. nevertheless, a step in the right direction could be taken at cop29 in azerbaijan, by adopting a new collective quantified goal on climate finance. northern countries would have another opportunity to begin closing the climate finance gap. the south must design a goal sufficient to meet its needs, with guarantees for development and social justice, in the face of massive challenges. debt cancellation—already repaid many times over—must be part of the solution. only a new international order can definitively save the human species: one that is just and democratic, guaranteeing peace and “the balance of the world”, enabling the right to development for all states under sovereign equality, increasing the participation and representation of developing countries in global governance and decision-making; one that ensures the common good, prosperity for all peoples, harmony with nature, and the sustainable management of natural resources; one that guarantees the exercise of all human rights for all people. we need a new civilised coexistence among nations, based on solidarity, international cooperation, integration, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, as alternatives to the “philosophy of plunder”, war, the use or threat of force, aggression, occupation, and hegemonic domination—cultural, political, financial, technological, or military. this must be an order without blockades or unilateral coercive measures, grounded in multilateralism and full respect for the un charter and international law. mr president, the united states government continues its relentless, harmful efforts to control cuba’s destiny. this is an old ambition, rooted in the monroe doctrine, which defines the imperialist, hegemonic nature of us policy towards cuba and latin america. the economic, commercial, and financial blockade is also political, technological, and communicational. it is a principal weapon of aggression, designed to destroy cuba’s economy, block financial inflows, provoke collapse, and generate political and social instability. the damage is visible, undeniable, and affects the daily lives of all cubans. it is accompanied by an intense disinformation campaign, persistent interference, and tolerated acts of violence and terrorism by groups operating from us territory. these actions violate international law, defy the principles of the un charter, and contradict countless resolutions of the general assembly. this siege has been intensified by cuba’s inclusion on the us state department’s arbitrary and infamous list of states that allegedly sponsor terrorism. this is a fraudulent designation, lacking moral authority or international mandate. it triggers extraterritorial reprisals beyond us jurisdiction, targeting countries worldwide. yet, in may 2024, the us state department itself acknowledged that cuba fully cooperates in the fight against terrorism. this admission has not eased the coercive measures, but it does make cuba’s presence on that illegitimate list even more incoherent and unjustifiable. presidential elections will soon be held in the united states. that is the exclusive affair of the american people—though, historically, the us government has interfered in elections and internal affairs of un member states, including its allies. history shows that regardless of election outcomes, anti-cuban politicians and interest groups, who have made aggression against cuba a lucrative business, will continue to have influence. they do not represent the will of the us majority, nor the cuban community residing in that country. whatever the outcome, cuba will defend its sovereign right to independence and to build socialism—as the cuban people have chosen—free of foreign interference. we will also continue advocating for a respectful, constructive relationship with the united states. mr president, in 2014, the community of latin american and caribbean states declared our region a zone of peace—a historic commitment that grows more relevant every day. we defend peace and multilateralism against unilateral coercive measures that because grave harm to syria, belarus, nicaragua, venezuela, zimbabwe, the dprk, iran, russia, cuba, and others. we firmly reject all attempts to undermine the constitutional order of our nations through coup tactics—as happened in bolivia in 2019 and again on 26 june, with attempts now being made in honduras. we denounce the attempts to destabilise venezuela and reaffirm our solidarity with the bolivarian and chavista government and the civic-military unity led by president nicolás maduro. calls to reject electoral results are irresponsible and disrespectful of the people's will and legitimate institutions. the destabilisation efforts against nicaragua must stop. the sandinista people will continue to have our full support. we reiterate support for the right of puerto rico to self-determination and independence. caribbean nations deserve fair, special, and differentiated treatment to address their challenges. we support their rightful demand for reparations for colonialism and slavery. the international community owes a historical debt to haiti, the first nation in the hemisphere to achieve independence through a revolution against slavery. we welcome efforts by caricom to support haiti’s sovereignty-respecting recovery. we support argentina’s sovereignty over the malvinas, south sandwich, and south georgia islands, and surrounding maritime spaces. we reaffirm our commitment to peace efforts in colombia, to which cuba will continue contributing as guarantor. africa, cradle of humankind, can always count on cuba’s unwavering support in its development journey. we reaffirm our solidarity with the sahrawi people and their right to self-determination. cuba rejects actions that seek to violate the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the people’s republic of china, condemns interference in its internal affairs, and reaffirms its unwavering support for the one-china principle, in line with resolution 2758 of this assembly. we advocate for a serious, constructive, realistic diplomatic solution to the war in ukraine, through peaceful means and in line with international law, ensuring the security and sovereignty of all. in this context, cuba supports the joint proposal by china and brazil for a political resolution to the crisis. mr president, let us unite our efforts to make multilateral institutions effective, and ensure they respond to the interests of the people—the humble, the poor, the vulnerable, and the exploited—who are the vast majority. let this be grounded in genuine equality, the exercise of all human rights, and respect for the sovereign rights of every nation. thank you very much.\n"
